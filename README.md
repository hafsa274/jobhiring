# jobhiring
JobHiring is a full-stack practice project where users can post jobs, apply for jobs, and fill contact forms. All submitted data is sent to a backend built with Node.js and stored in MongoDB. A custom admin dashboard allows easy viewing and management of all job posts, messages, and applications.
